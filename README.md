## üõ†Ô∏è Local Database Setup

### Mongo DB (Products Service)

   Download from [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass).

#### 2. Create DB and Collection
   - Open Compass and connect to `mongodb://localhost:27017`.
   - Create a database named `unibazaar`.
   - Inside it, create a collection named `products`.

#### 3. Set Environment Variable  
   - Copy the connection string (e.g., `mongodb://localhost:27017/unibazaar`).
   - In `Backend/Products/.env`, add (e.g.):
     ```env
     MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/unibazaar
     ```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS S3 Setup (for Image Uploads)

To enable image uploads in the Products Service using AWS S3, follow these steps:

#### 1. Create an S3 Bucket
- Go to the [AWS S3 Console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3).
- Click **Create bucket**, give it a name (e.g., `unibazaar`), and choose a region.

#### 2. Create an IAM User
- Go to the [IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).
- Create a new user with **Programmatic access**.
- Attach the **AmazonS3FullAccess** policy (or a custom policy with limited access to your bucket).

#### 3. Copy Credentials
- Note down the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** for the IAM user.

#### 4. Set Up Environment Variables
In `Backend/Products/.env`, add:

```env
AWS_REGION=<your-region>
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-access-key-id>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret-access-key>
AWS_S3_BUCKET=<your-s3-bucket-name>
AWS_CONSOLE=https://console.aws.amazon.com/
AWS_USER=<your-iam-username>
AWS_PWD=<your-iam-user-password>
```
